# TEI-files

This repository contains the XML-TEI digital editions of Spanish pliegos de cordel, published by the same Andalusian printer, José María Moreno (19th c.).
The schema used to validate those documents can be found in [Schema](https://github.com/DesenrollandoElCordel/TEI-files/tree/main/Schema).
